# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Data loading on Google Collab/Drive
- Data Visualization
- Model 1 created using basic CNN Architecture
- Model 2 created after adding Dropout layers
- Class imbalance handling using data augmentation
- Model 3 created on top of Augmented data and also adding batch normalization layer to model

## Conclusions
- Model 1 seem to be overfitting. There was huge diference between Train and Validation accuracy
- Model 2 was having less Train accuracy then Model 1 and Validation accuracy was decreased.
- Model 3 gave the highest accuracy for both Train and Validation dataset.
